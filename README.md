OVERVIEW: This repository is for viewing purposes only. It is a public version of a repository that I created to analyze gas and electricity usage and spending data as an Applied Data Fellow in Cook County's Bureau of Asset Management. The sensitive information from the original repository has been removed, including the data to be analyzed. The goal of this project was to create a Dash dashboard showing, through both tables and charts, the energy usage and spending patterns of Cook County over the last three years. The resulting dashboard has two tabs that the user is able to switch between: the main tab and the averages tab. On the main tab, four dropdowns are rendered that give the user the ability to select whether to depict gas or electricity data, then usage or spending data, whether the data should be grouped by properties or offices (offices are numbered collections of properties), and which of these properties or offices should be included. Based on these selections, a chart and a table depicting three years of the selected data are rendered. On the averages tab, the user is able to select an office or property and a set of months from two dropdowns. When this is done, two tables with four columns each will be shown on the tab. The first shows the electricity usage, electricity spending, gas usage, and gas spending associated with the selected office for each of the months selected. The second table shows the mean of each of these columns.

NOTICE: The Python scripts contained in this public version of the repository will not run properly, due to the fact that these supporting files have been removed.
